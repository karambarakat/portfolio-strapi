# Media Cloud:

for this project I will be using Cloudinary to upload all the media. see the configuration I made at `/config/plugin.js`

# ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

This portfolio is being deployed by [Heroku](heroku.com). every push to the `master` branch will automatically deploy to Heroku and trigger a new version.

there are two main branches:

1. master: will trigger new version on Heroku.
2. develop: the default branch to commit any new code, the code here is to be merged with the master branch.
